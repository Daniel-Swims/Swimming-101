    <h1>Swimming 101!</h1>
    <p>Hello swimmers! This is a website for all your swimming needs. I know it can be difficult when joining a swim club. I have been in MVCC(Moon Valley Country Club) for quite some time and I'm still learning every day. Swimmers, if you have any questions, they should all be here for you. Thanks!</p>

  <h2> What is an IM?</h2>
  <p>A IM is basically the 4 strokes of swimming. First, you have butterfly, then backstroke, then breaststroke, and finally freestyle. Another name for an IM is a Medley. An IM can range from 100 yards/meters to 400 yards/meters.</p>
  <h3> All 4(four) strokes of swimming!</h3>
  <ul>
<li>Butterfly-This stroke, in my opinion, is the one that requires the most upper body strength. There are 2 parts to butterfly; the arms and the kick. In simple terms, for every 1 pull or stroke there are 2 kicks. To breath, lift your head halfway through your stroke.</li>
<li>Backstroke-Like the name, backstroke is swam on your back. It is the same as freestyle strokes and kick just flipped over. In backstroke, there is no need to take a breath.</li>
<li>Breaststroke- Breaststoke is my favorite stroke. It is when you do a pull followed by a kick(frog kick). When breathing, lift up your head when pulling the water.</li>
<li>Freestyle-This is the most popular stoke in swimming. It is when you flutter kick while pulling the water arm by arm. To breath, move your head to the side as you do your stroke.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Swim Meets!</h3>
<p> Swim Meets are not for the faint of heart. They can take a long time. Now a long time in this sense is about 5 hours. I have had swim meets that lasted up to 6 hours and I only swam 3 or 4 different events. What are events you may ask, well they are the stroke and yards/meters you swim.
In swim meets, there can be up to 30 events a day. You will get lucky when there are only a short amout of events that take about 30-45 minutes each. Inside each event are heats. Heats are the seperate groups of people that swim in the pool. They consist of people who have the same times or close to.</p>
<p> To sign up or join a swim meet, your club's website should have a sign up on there. There are certain meets where you have to be USA Swimming registered. When you register you get a sticker and a card with your name, year, and member I.D.</p>

<h3>Short Course(SCY OR SCM) and Long Course.</h3>
<p>Short Course: Short course is like its name; it is shorter than long course. It can be measured in meters or yards depending on the pool. Some pools are able to switch from long course to short course. Times are also different times for Short Course meters or yards and Long Course.</p>
<p>Long Course: Long course is well, long. It is measured in meters and its full length is 50 meters. Compared to a short course pool, long course is 2 short course pools.</p>
<h3>PRACTICE!</h3>
<p>Practice is key. Perfect practice makes perfect! I would suggest at least 2 practices a week. If you are looking to become more proficient in your strokes practice at least 4 times a week.</p>
